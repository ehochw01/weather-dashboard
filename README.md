## Description

This application uses the openweathermap Weather API to display the weather for a given city. The user can search a city of their choice. Then the temperature, wind speed, and humidity for the current day and the next 5 days are displayed in imperial units. The UV Index for the current day is displayed as well. The weather data is displayed when the city inputs a city and clicks the search button. The user's 10 most previous cities that they searched are stored, and displayed to the screen as buttons. They are displayed from most recent to least recently searched. If the user clicks the buttons for one of these cities, the weather data is displayed for the city.
